# ðŸŽ¯ Final Navigation Timing Fix

## Root Cause Identified

**Issue**: `handleNavigate()` returned success immediately after `tabs.update()`, but page was still loading. When Claude Code sent the next command, content script wasn't ready yet.

## Fix Applied

**Location**: `background.js:141-168`

**Changes**: 
- Added `waitForTabLoaded()` function that waits for `webNavigation.onCompleted`
- `handleNavigate()` now waits for page to finish loading before returning success
- 10-second timeout fallback to prevent hanging

## Update Steps

1. **Firefox** â†’ `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Find "Browser MCP" â†’ Click **"Reload"** 
3. Reconnect extension (Connect button in popup)

## Test Now

Try the YouTube search command again:
```
Navigate to YouTube and search for baxtrix
```

Should work without any "Receiving end does not exist" errors!
